# heritage-building-bidding-in-metaverse-research-paper
This repository contains the research and implementation of a VCG-based Auction Mechanism integrated with Blockchain and NFTs for heritage restoration in the Metaverse.

The project introduces a novel system that leverages:

Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auctions for transparent and equitable allocation of restoration rights.

Smart contracts & NFT minting for secure ownership representation.

DAO-based governance for participative decision-making and accountability.

A custom simulation environment was developed using Ethereum’s Ganache testnet to evaluate auction performance. Comparisons were made with leading mechanisms such as First-Price Auctions (FPA), Generalized Second Price (GSP), and Random Allocation models. Results demonstrated:

✅ 100% truthfulness

✅ Higher social welfare (8450)

✅ High fairness (95/100)

✅ Strong blockchain security & integration

✅ 92% community engagement

This framework provides a scalable, community-led pathway for preserving digital cultural heritage and opens doors for broader applications of auction-based decentralized infrastructure within the Metaverse and beyond.
